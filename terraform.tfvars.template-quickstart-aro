####  Portworx storage

# Uncomment and include the path to the Portworx spec file (refer to https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/terraform-azure-portworx) if using the portworx storage
# Make sure this path is visible from where you are running terraform/terragrunt.
# If you are using the container approach, put the spec file into the root path for the cloned repository. This will be visible as /terraform in the container.
# The spec file would then be at /terraform/<px-filename> within the container.
#azure-portworx_portworx_spec_file=""

# Alternately, the base64 encoded portworx yaml file can be put into the credentials.properties file.
